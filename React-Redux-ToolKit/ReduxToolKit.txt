What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is an official library that:
    Simplifies Redux setup
    Uses Immer so you can write “mutating” logic safely
    Encourages best practices by default
    Includes async handling tools
👉 It replaces most old-school Redux patterns.

Core Concepts (RTK way):

1. Store
The global state container.

2. Slice
A slice = state + reducers + actions in one file.

3. useSelector & useDispatch
Hooks to read and update state in React components.
