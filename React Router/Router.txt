1️⃣ What is React Router?

React Router is a library for React that lets you handle navigation between different components/pages in a React app without reloading the whole page.

Normally, in a website, when you click a link, the browser reloads the page.

In React apps, we usually want a Single Page Application (SPA) where navigation happens smoothly without full page reloads.

React Router gives you tools to do this.

2️⃣ How React Router works

React Router works by changing what React renders based on the URL. It uses the History API in the browser to manipulate the URL without reloading the page.

Key concepts:

Concept	What it does
<BrowserRouter>	Wraps your app and enables routing using browser history (pretty URLs)
<Routes>	A container for your route definitions
<Route>	Defines a path and which component to render for that path
<Link>	Like <a>, but changes URL without reloading the page
useNavigate	Hook to programmatically navigate to another route

3️⃣ Why use React Router?

SPA experience – No page reloads → smoother, faster navigation.

Dynamic URLs – You can use URLs to display different content (/profile/123).

Nested routes – Complex layouts can have routes inside routes.

Programmatic navigation – Move users around based on actions (useNavigate()).

4️⃣ What happens without React Router?

If you don’t use React Router:

You’d rely on regular HTML links (<a> tags).

Clicking a link reloads the whole page, losing React state.

You cannot easily make a SPA with multiple pages.

URL-based navigation and browser history are harder to manage.


1️⃣ Normal HTML Links (no React Router)
User clicks <a href="/about">
        |
        v
Browser reloads the page
        |
        v
Server sends the /about HTML page
        |
        v
React re-mounts the app from scratch


Problem: Full reload → all React state is lost.

2️⃣ React Router (SPA)
User clicks <Link to="/about">
        |
        v
React Router intercepts the click
        |
        v
URL changes to /about WITHOUT reloading
        |
        v
React renders <About /> component
        |
        v
State and app stay intact


Benefit: Smooth navigation → SPA experience, no reloads.
