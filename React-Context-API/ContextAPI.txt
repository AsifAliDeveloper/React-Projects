1️⃣ What is Context API?

The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to share data across components without passing props manually at every level.

Normally in React:

If you have data in a parent component and many nested child components need it, you pass it down through props.

This can become annoying and messy, especially if components are deeply nested. This problem is called “prop drilling.”

Context API solves prop drilling by letting you create a global-ish data store that multiple components can access directly.

2️⃣ How does Context API work?

Context API has three main parts:

Create Context
You create a context using React.createContext().

import React from 'react';
const MyContext = React.createContext();


Provide Context
Wrap the components that need access to the data with a Provider. The provider has a value prop that passes the data.

<MyContext.Provider value={someData}>
    <App />
</MyContext.Provider>


Consume Context
Any component inside the provider can access the data in two ways:

Using useContext hook:

import React, { useContext } from 'react';
const data = useContext(MyContext);


Using Context.Consumer component (less common in modern React):

<MyContext.Consumer>
  {data => <div>{data}</div>}
</MyContext.Consumer>

3️⃣ Why use Context API?

Avoid prop drilling: You don’t need to pass props through every component.

Centralized state: Useful for global data like:

User authentication info

Theme (dark/light mode)

Language settings

Cart data in e-commerce apps

Cleaner code: Makes your component tree simpler and more maintainable.

1. General Syntax of Context API
Step 1: Create Context
import React, { createContext } from "react";

const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue);


defaultValue is optional. It’s used if no Provider wraps the component.

Step 2: Provide Context
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
  {/* components that need the context */}
</MyContext.Provider>


value is the data you want to share.

All child components inside the Provider can access this data.

Step 3: Consume Context
Option A: useContext Hook (functional component)
import { useContext } from "react";

const value = useContext(MyContext);

Option B: Context.Consumer (class component)
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => (
    <div>{value}</div>
  )}
</MyContext.Consumer>
